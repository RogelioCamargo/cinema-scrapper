Weaving between the day-to-day lives of various poverty-stricken small-town outcasts, GUMMO’s scattershot structure and varied shooting styles present a collage of American themes on the precipice of an unpredictable new millennium, ultimately yielding a movie that Gus Van Sant called “both bracingly realistic and hauntingly dreamlike.”",

      "description": "Director Terrence Malick’s lyrical tone poem set at the turn of the 20th century tracks impoverished Chicago couple Richard Gere and Brooke Adams as they migrate to the Texas Panhandle and masquerade as brother and sister to find farm work. When their smitten, terminally ill boss (Sam Shepard) proposes to Adams, the couple see a way out of their poverty. But after the marriage, Shepard seemingly recovers, and tragic complications gradually unfold. Gorgeous, thoughtful and at times achingly romantic, this ambitious working-class epic set the standard for Malick’s future films – passionate, moody and serene meditations on the human condition set in a tragic dimension. Nestor Almendros won the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Co-starring Linda Manz. ",

Almost all that remains are lone, surreal monuments – the futuristic, solemn, Brutalist stone slabs erected during the communist era in the former Yugoslav republics, arrestingly photographed in luminous 16mm black-and-white. A stunning feature debut and final cinematic testament from the late composer and musician Jóhann Jóhannsson (SICARIO, ARRIVAL, MANDY) conjures a world of surreal and phantasmagorical monuments, once intended as symbols of unity and brotherhood, now abandoned beacons beaming their message into the wilderness. Based on the cult 1930 science fiction novel by British author Olaf Stapledon, with narration by Tilda Swinton, LAST AND FIRST MEN is a poetic, hopeful and tragic work: an allegory of remembrance, ideals and the death of Utopia.",
