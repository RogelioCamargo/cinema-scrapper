When a young woman grieving the loss of her scream queen mother attends a repertory screening of mom’s most famous starring role, she and her friends get sucked directly into the mayhem on screen. Now they’ll have to use their wits, and the bonds of reunited family, if they’re to escape a Camp Bloodbath. Taissa Farmiga & Malin Akerman headline an excellent ensemble cast, while the screenplay by M.A. Fortin & Joshua John Miller deftly mixes the laughs and scares.",

      "description": "Being a teen girl is hard. You’ve got to deal with boys, boobs, bratty brothers and Brad, the hunky football star at school who doesn’t even know you’re alive. Uggghhh! But when you find out on your 16th birthday that you’re descended from Salem witches, life is, like, totally going to get complicated. But new powers bring new responsibilities and when you’re suddenly the most popular gal in town, sometimes the hardest thing to do is just be true to yourself. Teen Witch is a sweet-natured coming-of-age fairy tale and a non-stop fun machine dealing with the tough topics of today (rap battles, magical ability), a hilarious cotton candy comedy packed with teased-out neon fashion, a you’ll-never-get-it-out-of-your-head soundtrack of original songs (seriously, you’re gonna have to dig deep to Top That) and a cast with supernatural appeal: the duo of Robyn Lively and Dan Gauthier, Near Dark’s Joshua John Miller, and Poltergeist’s Zelda Rubinstein just to get started. So grab your wand and head to the New Bev to fall under the Teen Witch spell all over again!",

The film follows a talented teenage hoops prospect (Duane Martin) and his relationships with two men on different paths, a charismatic drug dealer (an electrifying Tupac Shakur) and a troubled former b-ball star (Leon), in the lead-up to the city’s big streetball tournament. Featuring Bernie Mac, Marlon Wayans, and Wood Harris in memorable supporting roles, plus a Source Awards-winning Soundtrack of the Year with tracks by 2Pac, Tha Dogg Pound, the debut of Nate Dogg & Warren G’s Regulate, and more.",

A handsome young stud rides his motorcycle through a myriad of sexual situations, from a soccer game’s locker room to a dreamy and unsettling orgy. This rediscovered gem is a labyrinth of all-male fantasies whose outstanding beauties always end up fading away while leaving their sensual protagonist dealing with his own loneliness. Directed by the mysterious Dietrich de Velsa (aka Francis Savel / Frantz Salieri), a former painter who was also the owner and artistic director of one of the first transvestites’ cabarets of Paris, the legendary La Grande Eugène. Years later, he collaborated with Joseph Losey on Mr. Klein and Don Giovanni. Equation to an Unknown is his only film and it stands as the best French gay porn ever made.",
